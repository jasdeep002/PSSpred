# The working of an acid buffer

A buffer is a mixture of a weak conjugate acid–base pair that stabilizes the pH of a solution by providing both a source and a sink for protons.

## Acid buffer and Base buffer

Acid buffer: A mixture of a weak acid and its salt will act as a buffer at pH < 7 (the acidic side of neutrality) and is known as an acid buffer. 

Base buffer: A mixture of a weak base and its salt will act as a buffer at pH > 7 (the basic side of neutrality) and is known as a basic buffer.
